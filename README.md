## Description

* A Node.js command-line application accepts user input via Inquirer. Application invoked by command: node index.js

* Users answer prompts to provide details about their team members. Each team will have one manager, and can have multiple Engineers and/or Interns.

* An Employee Constructor is used to require name, id, and email fields that all team member types/classes inherit. Managers, Engineers, and Interns also have fields unique to their role. 

* When user is done adding team members, an HTML webpage is created, displaying each team member and their details. Email and Github details link to those destinations.

* Testing for each part of the code was successful with Jest.
